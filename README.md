# Data Science Internship Program at [CloudcreditsTechnologies](www.cloudcreditstechnologies.in)

💼 This repository showcases my internship projects at [Cloudcredits Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudcredits-technology-pvt-ltd/), where I explored various Data Science workflows using Python. The process involved defining the problem, collecting and preparing data (including handling missing values), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, engineering relevant features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. I then selected and trained suitable machine learning models, evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics, and improved them through hyperparameter tuning or alternative approaches. Where applicable, models were deployed as APIs or applications for real-world use.

## 🔹Project 1: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media
### 📝 Description: 
Analyze social media posts or reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and train a sentiment analysis model. Visualize sentiment trends over time or by 
topic.

## 🔹Project 2: House Price Estimator 
### 📝 Description: 
Create a regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. Use data visualization to show the distribution of house prices and feature importance.

## 🔹Project 3: Customer Churn Predictor 
### 📝 Description: 
Develop a model to predict whether a customer will stop using a service based on historical data. Use classification techniques and feature engineering to improve model accuracy. Visualize the key factors contributing to churn.

## 🔹Project 4: Sales Forecasting 
### 📝Description: 
Develop a time series model to forecast future sales based on historical sales data. Experiment with different forecasting techniques like ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and machine learning models. Visualize the forecasted sales and compare model performance.

## 🔹Project 5: Movie Recommendation System
 • Description: Build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences. Use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach. Visualize user preferences and recommendation accuracy.


## 🔹Project 6: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic 
• Description: Detects anomalies in network traffic data to identify potential security threats or unusual activity. Use unsupervised learning techniques like clustering or autoencoders. Visualize normal vs. anomalous traffic patterns. 

## 🔹Project 7:  Image Classification 
• Description: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into different categories (e.g., cats vs. dogs). Use data augmentation and transfer learning to improve model performance. Visualize the classification results and model accuracy. 

## 🔹Project 8: Energy Consumption Analysis 
• Description: Analyze and predict energy consumption patterns in a building or city. Use time series analysis and regression models to understand the factors affecting energy usage. Visualize energy consumption trends and model predictions.

## 🔹Project 9: Fraud Detection 
• Description: Develop a model to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data. Use classification algorithms and anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious activities. Visualize the distribution of normal vs. fraudulent transactions. 

## 🔹Project 10: Air Quality Monitoring 
• Description: Analyze air quality data to identify trends and patterns in pollution levels. Use clustering and regression techniques to understand the factors affecting air quality. Visualize air quality index (AQI) trends and predictions.
