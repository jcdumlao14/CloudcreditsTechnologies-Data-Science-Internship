# Data Science Internship Program at [CloudcreditsTechnologies](https://cloudcreditstechnologies.in/)

[![Watch Demo](https://github.com/jcdumlao14/CloudcreditsTechnologies-Data-Science-Internship/blob/main/cloudCredit-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif)](https://cloudcreditstechnologies.in/)

💼 This repository showcases my internship projects at [Cloudcredits Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudcredits-technology-pvt-ltd/), where I explored various Data Science workflows using Python. The process involved defining the problem, collecting and preparing data (including handling missing values), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, engineering relevant features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. I then selected and trained suitable machine learning models, evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics, and improved them through hyperparameter tuning or alternative approaches. Where applicable, models were deployed as APIs or applications for real-world use.

## **🔧 Project Structure:**
1. **🧠 *Define the Problem*:** Understand the objective and type of problem (classification, regression, etc.).
2. **🗂️ *Collect and Prepare Data*:** Obtain the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess data.
3. **📊 *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:** Visualize data to understand patterns and correlations.
4. **🧪 *Feature Engineering*:** Select and create relevant features.
5. **🔀 *Split the Data*:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. **🤖 *Choose a Model*:** Select a suitable machine learning algorithm.
7. **🏋️ *Train the Model*:** Train the model using the training set.
8. **📈 *Evaluate the Model*:** Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the model on the test set.
9. **🔧 *Improve the Model*:** Tune hyperparameters, try different algorithms, or enhance features.
10. **🚀 *Deploy the Model (optional)*:** Create an application or API to make predictions using the trained model.

## 🔹[Project 1: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media](https://github.com/jcdumlao14/CloudcreditsTechnologies-Data-Science-Internship/blob/main/Project_1_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Social_Media.ipynb)
### 📝 Description: 
Analyze social media posts or reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and train a sentiment analysis model. Visualize sentiment trends over time or by 
topic.
