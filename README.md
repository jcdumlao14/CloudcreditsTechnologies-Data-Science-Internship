# Data Science Internship Program at CloudcreditsTechnologies

ðŸ’¼ This repository showcases my internship projects at Cloudcredits Technologies, where I explored various Data Science workflows using Python. The process involved defining the problem, collecting and preparing data (including handling missing values), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, engineering relevant features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. I then selected and trained suitable machine learning models, evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics, and improved them through hyperparameter tuning or alternative approaches. Where applicable, models were deployed as APIs or applications for real-world use.
